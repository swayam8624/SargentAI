# SargentAI
This project aims to build an AI-driven traffic management system to predict traffic volumes and suggest optimal and alternative paths based on real-time data. The system uses an LSTM model (via TensorFlow) to forecast traffic congestion and employs graph-based algorithms to route vehicles optimally.
